# Ultimate Chrome 2

## Replit has made some changes to it's deployment, and UC2 doesn't work too well anymore... Now, you can fork it and use it if you'd like, but if you want to get a new way to browse the internet unblocked, [join our Discord server today!](https://discord.gg/q562hPrzAp)

Run a window of Google Chrome in repl.it! Complete with saving cookies & local storage. No setup is required.

***Please, please PLEASE don't use this to abuse repl.it or your school/workplace's filter! This is just a fun project I threw together with some neat features from selenium.***

This *new* version starts **instantly**, and saves/loads cookies & local storage far more reliably than v1. It's also a load faster! Start using it today! 

**HOW TO USE**: Just hit run! It should start up super-fast!

Cookies will automatically save every minute, or when you stop the repl.

Next time, when you reload, it will restore all of your cookies.
